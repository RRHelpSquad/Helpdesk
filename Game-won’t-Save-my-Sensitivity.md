To fix this issue, follow the steps below: 

**1. Open File Explorer**

**2. Navigate to “My Documents”**

**3. Click on “My Games”**

**4. Click on “paladinsroyale”**

**5. Click on “RealmGame”**

**6. Click on “Config”**

**7. Open “RealmInput.ini” in notepad++ or other text editing software**

_7.1. Look for the line: “MouseSensitivity=”_

_7.2. Update the number after the “=”_

_7.3. Save the file_

**8. To make sure Realm Royale doesn’t update the config file, we need to mark it as read only.**

_8.1. Right Click on the file_

_8.2. Click on Properties_

_8.3. Check “Read-Only”_

_8.4. Hit Apply_


_**After you’ve done the steps above the game won’t be able to save new config to this file, if you wish the game to save new config to this file. Make sure you remove the tick “Read-only” which you ticked in step 8.**_
